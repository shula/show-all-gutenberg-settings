# show-all-gutenberg-settings
Wordpress devs hide settings, because novice users are "overwhelmed" by seeing "bold", "align", and "font color"...  
So they prefer to cripple everyone elses usability. 
But they don't offer any configuration alternative for advanced users! WTF ?!
Lots of users ask about it, but, as Moderators in wordpress forums are tyranical burocracts, and that sums it up.

They forget I already need to remember a million other things besides "what & where is the settings, for any block in the system... and plugins... which is changing..."

just one example: 
to set a different font name for a block, you need to click & scroll maybe **6 times** just to get to the see the font selector. 
and once you focus on another control, the pane is closed, again!
Imagine you need to change font in 20 times.

This code should continuously reveal all settings in the designer. FTW

## Future features:
always show design settings panel.

## Wishful thinking:
display ALL settings, in one compact list, same as property settings panel in visual development environments.
